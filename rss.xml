            Has been a bit more than a year since I started in the Codevis project. It also has been a couple of months since my presentation on Akademy 2023, and I feel like it is time to write a bit about the software in a blog post.

            The 2D diffusion equation is a very simple and fun equation to solve, from which we can generate quite pretty 2D
            plots with. In this post I go through a set of ideas that I accumulated over the years while I was studying
            similar problems.
